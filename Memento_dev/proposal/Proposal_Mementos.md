# Memento.co
_proposed taglines:_
<br> 
Life&rsquo;s memories in one place <br>
Life... presented



## History / Intro 
<!-- ###(Include Brand Positioning) -->

Memento.co is proposed as an organizational tool and presentation creator for telling life stories, in part or in whole. Memento&rsquo;s building blocks can include photos, video, text, graphics, and sound files provided by the user and uploaded to the website. Using various transitional devices reminiscent of the New York Times _Snowfall_ article, Memento.com allows for creation of an elegant, engaging presentation. Presentations can be made public or private, or limited access to friends or family members can be given. This product's branding should be associated with sites like Ancestry.com and other geneology focused sites.


## Project Goals and Issues

**Goals**

Memento.co proposes to

- serve as a creation tool for interactive online presentations focusing on family histories and personal stories

- serve as a repository for family mementos including:
	- photos
	- video
	- music
	- text
	- additional graphics including timelines, family trees, maps and charts

- allow for seamless integration of text, images, sound and video into a scrolling historical narrative via an intuitive user interface

**Issues**

Possible issues include

- technical issues incorporating Javascript into the assembly of user assets

- managing assets in an efficient manner in order to optimize the scrolling presentation


## Audience

The target audience for the website includes those already armed with the geneological research and various media and text information necessary. 

## Competitive Market Study

Already existing sites such as Ancestry.com, focusing on  geneological research, and Weeva.com which produces printed books telling family stories, are in similar fields but with significantly different goals.

Forgetmenotbook.com is a similar idea to Weeva, but with a poorly designed end product.

Sharing links with Ancestry.com is a possibility as their services do not provide any sort of presentation of the data amassed via their site.



## SWOT Analysis

**Strengths**

A new presentation option for family histories in an elegant, scrolling interactive format.

Research so far shows that nothing quite like this proposed web service currently exists.

**Weaknesses**

Similar to exposure.co (but with family histories)
Similar subject matter to ancestry.com (but with media integrated into the mix)

**Opportunities**

Take the lead in the trend for a _snowfall_ style presentation creator for personal and family histories

**Threats**

The New York Times? They threatened Skrollkit for recreating _Snowfall_ using their own software to prove it was doable in a much shorter time frame than the 6 weeks it took the NYTimes. 

And a company called Marquee that develops publishing systems that have automated a similar style of scrolling web design.

## "This not that"

<!-- (less web focused, e.g.: 
more cat lady than crazy cat lady)

 National Geographic&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;_Not Time magazine_

Friendly&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;_Not cold_

Your grandmother&rsquo;s attic (memories, stories)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;_Not Goodwill (no memories, no stories)_

Diamonds (classic, enduring)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;_Not costume jewelry (trendy, temporary)_

## Game Plan 
<!-- (as detailed as possible, describing technical possibilities) -->

The project entails creating a scolling website that integrates text, images and sound. Using Javascript to create a series of reveals of fixed images by scrolling fields placed on top, or a similar situation in which titles or text scrolls over a fixed image, these elements and their transitions must be timed and planned to coincide with the reading experience. A full screen layout seems the most obvious choice for laying out these presentations including the sample presentation. No margins seem appropriate to give it a "wide screen" cinematic feel. Type must be chosen carefully to give a modern but classic sensitivity. Legibility tests must be done for laying scrolling text over images. White  space will play a big part in giving pauses between the appearance of images. Javascript tests must be done early on in order to seek out any problems quickly. The project will be a repository not only for the assets supplied by the user, but also the final web presentation created via the site's tools.


## Project Deliverables 

- A website including the following pages:

	1. Homepage
	2. Sample scrolling presentation 
	3. Log-in page
	4. Interface for media integration and presentation creation

- A website style guide
