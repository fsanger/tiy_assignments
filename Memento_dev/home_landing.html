 				<h2>From the Blue Mountains of the French Vosges</h2>

 				<p>
					The beautiful Vosges mountains of northeastern France are home to fresh spring waters, evergreen ringed lakes, and the misty blue tones of rounded peaks hiding one behind the other in the distance. As part of the province of Lorraine, this region has shared with Alsace a history of disputed rule between France and Germany. Interestingly, the chaos and disruption of war in this region not only allowed my maternal grandparents’ paths to cross during the First World War, but also brought my parents together during World War II.

					My mother’s mother, christened Marguerite Daniel, was the daughter of Aristide Daniel and Marie Demenge Daniel, owners of a well-loved restaurant and butcher shop in the small town of Deyvillers, near Epinal in the department of the Vosges.
