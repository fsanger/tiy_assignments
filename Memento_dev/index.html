 				<h2>How does it work?</h2>

 				<p>Creating a Memento is all about gathering your cherished memories in their various forms… Stories. Photos. Videos. Music. 
 				</p>

				<p>
 				Once you’ve collected these elements, you can organize them and use them to embellish your story, placing them on a timeline. Then, pick the photos you’d like to emphasize, and make them backgrounds. Include smaller images throughout your story. Add music and film clips if you like. Once all your elements are in place, preview your Memento presentation, and save it for viewing and sharing.

				 When we think of memories, photographs often come to mind. And Memento.me is a great place to gather, store and organize them into a Memento presentation. But don’t forget to think about including videos, music or other sound clips. Add a voice recording that retells a part of the story. Or why not add a graphic of a family tree, or a map? All these make the story come alive. Files can be easily uploaded and organized on Memento.me to create your Memento presentation.

				<h4> <em>STEP TWO</em> <br>Curate your Memento</h4>

				<p class="psteps">
				Use one of our templates to curate the elements of your Memento. Drop in your story and your collected elements and use one of our templates to help sequence elements, place scrolling text over an image or video, and place images and video as smaller elements within your story.

<!-- 				<h5>
				Option 2 
				</h5>  -->
				<p class="psteps">
				Or you can create your own custom Memento presentation using the timeline which offers flexibility for a truly unique presentation. The timeline allows you to place the elements as you’d like, preview the presentation and rearrange as desired.

				<h4> <em>STEP THREE</em> <br>Save your Memento</h4>

				<p class="psteps">
				 When your Memento is ready, save it and feel free to make it public. You can allow full or limited access as you like, or keep it completely private. Your files are saved in the cloud and always accessible should you want to add to or re-curate your Memento.
