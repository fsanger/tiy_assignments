Hackathon...

Just the sound of it is intimidating.
Working on a team project... What will that be like? Will I be interested in the project? How will my only basic knowledge of Github playout. Will I be able to "git" stuff to the repository as needed without overwriting one of my teammate's work?  Lots of questions.

As it turns out, the project is fairly straightforward, an app to minimize commute time to its shortest possible time by using an API (probably from Google) to monitor projected times for a trip from point A to point B. The most obvious use seems to be to pinpoint the shortest upcoming time slot for travelling during a certain window of time, most often rush hour.

The project entails a lot of work for Mike, the Rails guy, and Logan, the Front End guy, in figuring out how to implement the Google APIs integral to determining the best departure times. Mike is researching how the APIs should work, while Logan's role this first evening was to begin putting together an initial HTML file which I will in turn add to and style using SCSS. I began an initial StyleTile this evening along with research on layout ideas from a site called iOSPatterns.com (Thanks,Tony!) and Pttrns.com.
