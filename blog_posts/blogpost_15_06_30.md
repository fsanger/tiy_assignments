I‘m writing this blog post after the fact, hence …post. Writing today about the last few days‘ project assignments. We‘ve mostly been working on a website redesign for a restaurant of our own choosing for the last week. I picked an old Austin Tex-Mex restaurant which dates back to the mid-50s, El Gallo, conveniently located just up the way on South Congress. 

After some initial obstacles in getting in touch with the owner or manager, I got their buy-in to drop by and take some photos. I knew the place had a long history in Austin, and indeed it feels like a blast from the past… a relic of another time: dark furniture, dim dining room lighting with some surprising treasures mixed in.

My visit turned up some great artwork which I was able to integrate into the site redesign.
The menu page came together in the last few days with a functional responsive design which I’m pretty happy with. Fairly successful typographically, (though I do see some things that need tweaking, as always…), it feels like the first web project that I‘ve had complete control over both the technical and design sides, hopefully successfully designing both the functionality and the visual sides into a complete solution.

The responsive aspect (using variable width grids and media queries) was the exciting part to see in the resulting functioning site. Sam posted the essence of who I was yesterday afternoon on Slack... me endlessly resizing the browser window to get a sense of how the site would _respond_ to a range of browser window sizes. Though it‘s still challenging, I’m feeling more comfortable with the RWD aspect of UI design.
