### _Prologue_

After many years of avoiding it like the plague, I finally decided to take the leap and jump seriously into web design.
So  here I’ll be telling you about my experience in a twelve week immersive UI (User Interface) Design class at The Iron Yard, a coding school in Austin.

### Week 1

Had to get my bearings here…used to live in Austin back in the 80’s and early 90s. 
Obviously, things have changed a lot.
Not having spent much time here in over 15 years leads to some disorienting confrontations… 
It’s a bit surreal to be riding around town and only find one building you recognize on a whole block, and everything else surrounding it gone or totally changed, like one building has been dropped there from a spaceship time travelling from the past.

After a long Memorial Day weekend to settle in, The Iron Yard was welcoming and supportive and Sam, our instructor, incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The first few days we jumped right into HTML with tons of exercises about every aspect you could think of. I knew it was just the beginning, but didn’t know how fast and furious the info would continue to be thrown at us.

And when I say thrown, I should qualify it… If you can throw something graciously, Sam does that. Good initial explanations, followed by lots of practice exercises to get you at ease with the new information you’ve been given. Sometimes the info sticks right away, other times, it takes some time to absorb. Sometimes I felt like I was drowning in these new languages, gasping for air not filled with terms, rules, dos and don’ts. Floats, Display, Positioning… all these mysterious parts that add up to functional HTML… and a website.

Our first weekend assignment was to recreate what seemed then to be a complicated project. In retrospect, it’s fairly simple… So, now I try to reassure myself: you felt overwhelmed by HTML initially. Keep that in mind. You’re always going to feel challenged by new info that’s coming at you. That’s what learning’s about.

### Week 2

Spent the majority of the first weekend working on the homework assignment. It came together but it was painfully slow and frustrating. I decided to attack one thing at a time and not focus on all I had to do, that was the only way to proceed. It got done, but not much time for anything else. So be it.

Monday we plunged into Github and iTerm/the terminal. Woah, this seemed dangerous: messing around with my ‘puter’s innards? You do what you gotta do. I decided to go with the flow. 

Then, CSS appeared. Initially overwhelming, it was also obvious how much easier it could make your life coding. Things fell into place, not always how you wanted, but even so, you saw the benefits. Divs (“when in doubt, put it in a div”), allowed CSS to make HTML what you intended. Completed the Shay Howe CSS online lessons, another good way to see all the possibilities that CSS offers. A lot to take in, but helpful.

All in all, I was grasping what was going on, even if it was taking me way longer than would seem reasonable to achieve some basic projects. I felt inept sometimes, but realized I wasn’t alone and that others in the class, were also struggling at some point or another. All this was a lot of info to process. I began to figure out ways to congratulate myself for making it as far as I had. In two weeks I had learned quite a lot, even though I hadn’t mastered it yet.

And hold on, because, unbeknownst to us, _just over that thar hill_, was looming… Sass.
