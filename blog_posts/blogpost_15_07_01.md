# Meet Jekyll (no Hyde)

Today we started learning about Jekyll, the content management system hosted by Github. It allows for management of our personal websites including blog, portfolio, and about pages among others. Functioning as a funnel system (my terminology, one way to look at it), Jekyll provides a default (formatable) framework which contains individual layouts which in turn hold specific content whether it be portfolio items, individual blog posts or other items further down the branching chain.  

Cool to be able to manage all a personal website‘s content in an organized way via Github’s repository system, which also hosts the site.
