		<h3 id="selected_1">introduction</h3>

		<div id="section-collapse_1">

			<div class="inner-div-text">
				<p> GoodReads was founded in 2007 by Otis and Elizabeth Chandler, a husband and wife team who wished to help people &ldquo;find and share books they love.&rdquo; Using the site’s lists and social networking features, book lovers can find new selections, catalogue, rate and recommend books, and make lists of their favorites to share with others.
				</p> 

				<p>
				The site in its current state includes an extensive number of features which are unwieldy and often hard to find. The existing design also lacks hierarchy in color, typography and graphics. This lack of visual hierarchy amplifies the repetitive nature of listing books and their lengthy metadata, and offers a bland, flat experience for the user.
				</p>

				<p>
				The goal of this website redesign was to create a more appealing user experience that would integrate two major user goals&mdash;finding new books and sharing favorites with others&mdash;via the process of cataloguing and sorting books into groups called &ldquo;shelves.&rdquo; 	</p>
			
				<p>
				Essential to this goal was the creation of an over-arching visual hierarchy to guide the user through the website in a seamless manner. The development of typographic and icon systems and an energetic color palette orders the information in an appealing way, while giving the site a light-hearted feel.
				</p>

		<h3 id="selected_2">color palette</h3>

		<div id="section-collapse_2">

			<div class="inner-div-text">

				<p>The main palette of playful, bright color evokes the joys of reading. A set of neutral grays and black serve to ground these colors in addition to providing the visual framework for the site.
				</p>

				<p>Three colors&mdash;medium values of green, orange, and blue&mdash;are used to give equal visual importance to three &ldquo;reading&rdquo; icons. These colors are also used to delineate certain elements and sections.
				</p>

				<p>In addition, red identifies main section titles as well as the member&rsquo;s name in the profile section. It is also applied to a limited number of accent graphics, including the heart icon used for &ldquo;like-ing&rdquo; a book.
				</p>

				<p>Three additional pale accent colors are used solely as background color fields which delineate folder sections and sidebars.
				</p> 

				<p>Three neutrals including black and a dark and medium gray are used for text, framing books  and for divider lines, both dotted and solid.
				</p>	

			</div>			

		</div>

		<h3 id="selected_3">grid system</h3>

		<div id="section-collapse_3">

			<div class="inner-div-text">

				<div>
				<p> The redesign uses a 24-column grid for the large and medium screen formats allowing for maximum flexibility in laying out a variety of content. For smaller screen devices, the grid collapses to a single or double column.
				</p>
				</div>

		<h3 id="selected_4">typography</h3>

		<div id="section-collapse_4">

			<div class="inner-div-text">

				<p>The primary typography for the GoodReads site uses two related font families: Museo Slab and Museo Sans. 
				</p>

				<p>
				Museo Slab, the font used in the creation of the GoodReads wordmark, is a slab-serif font which implies  solidity and makes reference to the typewriter, an essential tool of the modern-day writer. It was chosen for its legibility and versatility, along with its sister font, Museo Sans.
				</p> 

				<p>
				Museo Sans, is a sans serif which serves as a secondary font used to differentiate certain types of text information.
				</p>

				<p>
				A third font, the sans serif Enzo Bold, is used solely for book titles, and only in black, to give them additional importance.
				</p>

			</div>

		</div>

		<h3 id="selected_5">wordmark</h3>

		<div id="section-collapse_5">

			<div class="inner-div-text">

				<p>The GoodReads wordmark aludes to the written word and the richness of world literature by its typographic reference to the typewriter, an essential tool of the modern-era writer. The wordmark appears in black and gray on a white background.
				</p> 

				<p>The wordmark always appears with its graphic companion, the multicolored dotted line. The alternating colors of the dotted line graphic run the full page-width along the bottom of the main header bar,(as in this style guide), and are not repeated elsewhere on the page. This dotted line graphic is always accompanied by a solid underline in black.
				</p>

			</div>	

		</div>


		<h3 id="selected_6">graphic elements</h3>

		<div id="section-collapse_6">

			<div class="inner-div-text">


				<p>
				A flexible system of icons, labels and other graphic elements provides clear navigating through the site and enhances the user&rsquo;s experience.
				</p>

				<h4> icons </h4>

				<p>
				A set of three icons designate a user&rsquo;s reading status for any book: <span>finished reading</span> | <span>now reading</span> | <span>want to read</span>. These clickable icons always appear in their assigned color and with their identifying text label.
				</p>

				<h4> labels </h4>

				<p>
				Labels are used to identify sections of interest defined in sidebars and also serve as links to those pages. Examples of labels of this type are the <span>Listopedia</span> and <span>Friends&rsquo; Reviews</span> sections. They include black text in Museo Slab 700 on a white background, with a vertically centered black point before and after the text, all framed with a colored 2 pixel rectangular border. 
				</p>

				<h4>buttons and links</h4>
				<p>hover state</p>
				<p>normal state</p>	
				<h4>ratings</h4>
				
				<p>
				Ratings are indicated by five gray outlined stars which are filled with orange to indicate a rating for a particular book. If the rating is a consolidation of users&rsquo; ratings, the rating&rsquo;s numerical value is posted to the right of the star rating.
				</p>

				<h4>search bars</h4>
				<p>
				A search bar is located at the top of each page for site-wide searches. On the <span>My Books</span> page an additional search bar allows for searches within the user&rsquo;s collection. Search bars are rectangular shaped on the left side and rounded on the right, and are preceded by the word search and a search icon in gray.
				</p>

			</div>

		</div>


		<h3 id="selected_7">images</h3>

		<div id="section-collapse_7">

			<div class="inner-div-text">
				<p>
				There are two distinct image treatments in the GoodReads website: one for book cover images and another for portrait photos.
				</p>

				<p>
				Book cover images are presented with a white margin bordered by a single pixel black line. 
				In &ldquo;shelf&rdquo; display, book images maintain a consistent height, with image width fluctuating according to the proportions of the original book dimensions.
				</p>

				<p>
				Portrait photos of authors (those either writing or being reviewed on the site) and those of GoodReads members both appear in a circular format with a single pixel medium gray border. No margin, drop shadow or other treatment is used.
				</p>
